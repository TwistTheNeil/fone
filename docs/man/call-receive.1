.TH CALL-RECEIVE 1
.SH NAME
CALL-RECEIVE \- Receive phone calls using the fone protocol via a foneserver
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B call-receive
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B call-receive
is a client which uses the fone protocol to receive phone calls.
It will subscribe to +CLIP notification and will wait until the server responds on the receiving control pipe with a private transaction pipe for data exchange.
When
.B call-receive
receives a +CLIP notification (including contact number), it will prompt the user whether or not to answer the call from the contact number provided by the +CLIP.
If a user accepts the call, an ATA message is sent via a new command transaction.
A call may be dropped at any point by sending a SIGINT which will send a ATH message via a new command transaction.
The client may be stopped at any time by sending SIGQUIT which will also send a message 'finish' as a command transaction.
